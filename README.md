# paper-datatable

A material design implementation of a data table. Let's call this a pre-alpha release. I will hopefully be fixing it more and more over time and since upgrading to Polymer 1.2 I have a problem with some of the bindings (Issue #1), but the `card.html` demo seems to be in working order. I will gladly accept pull requests and I think it's pretty solid basis, but stuff like documentation and custom styling is still quite lacking.

## Installation

The element can be installed using bower using

    bower install --save David-Mulder/paper-datatable

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:
